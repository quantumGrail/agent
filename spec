**App Specification for Task Management Platform**

---

### **1. Overview**

The platform is designed to streamline task management, delegation, and execution in a highly automated, lean organization. It will empower team leaders (TLs) and managers to oversee progress without the need for constant manual intervention, while providing real-time notifications when tasks are at risk or not being completed. This system will focus on reducing redundancies and giving organizations the tools to track progress without micromanagement.

### **2. Key Features**

---

#### **2.1 Task Delegation & Tracking**

- **Automated Task Generation:**
  - Tasks are automatically created when failures or errors occur (e.g., failed unit tests or processes).
  - Tasks are tied to higher-level objectives, so they are part of a broader project’s lifecycle.
  - Tasks only appear when something needs immediate attention, minimizing noise from routine or successful processes.

- **Dynamic Task Assignment:**
  - Tasks can be assigned automatically to the relevant person or bot based on expertise and responsibility.
  - Responsibility chains should be built into the system to ensure appropriate delegation.
  - A role-based structure will help ensure the correct people or bots are assigned to relevant tasks.

- **Priority Escalation:**
  - If a task is not completed or resolved within the set time parameters (e.g., "by the end of the day"), the task automatically escalates to higher levels of responsibility.
  - Notifications and alerts are triggered when tasks fall behind or are at risk.

---

#### **2.2 Task Verification & Progress Monitoring**

- **Automated Progress Checking:**
  - Tasks should be able to verify their own completion status (e.g., a unit test running and then checking if it succeeded).
  - For tasks requiring external verification (e.g., testing code), automated agents can check results and notify the TL only if there is an issue.

- **Real-time Status Updates:**
  - The system automatically updates the status of tasks as they progress—completed, in-progress, failed, etc.
  - Managers and TLs only need to be notified when something goes wrong, reducing the need for manually checking progress.

- **Intelligent Notification System:**
  - When a task isn't completed according to set parameters, an alert is sent to the relevant stakeholders (e.g., TLs or higher-level management).
  - Notifications should be optimized based on priority and relevance, minimizing disruption.

---

#### **2.3 Initiative and Responsibility Tracking**

- **Hierarchical Task Structures:**
  - Task relationships should reflect organizational hierarchies, with managers, supervisors, and TLs overseeing multiple initiatives and tasks.
  - Tasks should be linked together across different roles, so if an issue arises, it can be tracked to its root cause.

- **Position-based Task Management:**
  - Managers, supervisors, and TLs should be able to manage multiple initiatives and have clear visibility over who is responsible for what.
  - Position management ensures that responsibilities are distributed correctly, and TLs can see progress without managing individual tasks.

- **Visibility into Dependencies:**
  - Tasks will have clear dependencies, allowing leadership to understand how work connects and the critical paths for completion.
  - This helps in understanding what initiatives need attention and how failures or delays impact other tasks.

---

#### **2.4 Automation & Bots**

- **Automated Task Agents:**
  - Bots can automatically initiate tasks (e.g., running tests, starting processes) and follow up on results.
  - Bots will also create follow-up tasks if something fails (e.g., sending a task to someone to fix a failed unit test).

- **Escalating Bot Functionality:**
  - If a bot fails or cannot resolve an issue, the system escalates the task to a human with the right level of responsibility.
  - Bots should have the ability to trigger other bots, creating a self-sustaining process chain.

---

#### **2.5 Performance Monitoring & Analytics**

- **Grading & Metrics:**
  - Automated performance grading will evaluate an individual or bot’s task completion over time (e.g., on-time completion percentage, failure rate).
  - Analytics will show how each individual or bot is performing on their initiatives.
  - Notifications can be triggered when performance dips below a certain threshold (e.g., "This person has missed 3 deadlines in a row").

- **Dynamic KPI Tracking:**
  - Managers can set custom Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are tracked automatically.
  - For example, a TL might want to monitor the average time to complete certain tasks or the number of failures in a given time period.

---

#### **2.6 User Interface (UI)/Experience (UX)**

- **Simple, Clean Dashboard:**
  - The dashboard will be minimal and only show what is necessary at the moment (i.e., tasks that require immediate attention).
  - Managers and TLs can see key data points such as overdue tasks, task escalations, and task completion status.

- **Visual Task Flow:**
  - Tasks should visually flow from initiation to completion, showing any dependencies and their current status.
  - Color-coded indicators and icons should be used to easily show task status (e.g., green for complete, yellow for in-progress, red for overdue).

- **Task Management Calendar:**
  - A calendar view should be available to visualize task deadlines, upcoming initiatives, and recurring tasks (e.g., weekly jobs).
  - The calendar should update automatically as tasks are completed or delayed.

---

#### **2.7 Communication & Collaboration Tools**

- **Integrated Messaging:**
  - Real-time communication channels should be integrated directly into task threads.
  - Team members can comment on tasks, upload files, and provide updates without needing to leave the app.

- **Automated Reporting:**
  - Managers and TLs will receive automated reports summarizing task status, failures, performance metrics, and initiative progress.
  - These reports can be customized in frequency and detail.

---

#### **2.8 Integration & Extensibility**

- **Third-Party Integrations:**
  - The app should integrate with popular tools (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Slack, etc.) for task creation and status updates.
  - Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines should trigger tasks automatically based on build/test results.

- **Customizable Workflows:**
  - Teams should be able to define custom workflows for task delegation, escalation, and completion tracking.
  - Workflow templates can be created for recurring processes.

---

### **3. Technical Requirements**

- **Cloud-Based:**
  - The system should be cloud-hosted, with high availability and scalability to handle both small and large teams.

- **Security:**
  - Task data and user information should be encrypted in transit and at rest.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to ensure only authorized users can access certain features or tasks.

- **API Access:**
  - Open API for integration with other tools and for custom automation.

- **Mobile & Desktop Support:**
  - Responsive design to support both desktop and mobile devices.

---

### **4. Future Considerations**

- **AI Integration:**
  - Over time, the platform could leverage machine learning to predict potential task failures or bottlenecks before they happen, based on past data.

- **Bot Intelligence Expansion:**
  - Bots could be made more sophisticated, such as using NLP (natural language processing) to understand and resolve tasks related to code changes or project requirements.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

This task management platform will be a highly automated and streamlined solution for organizations that want to reduce manual oversight and empower teams to operate efficiently. By focusing on intelligent delegation, real-time status updates, and automated failure management, it will provide team leaders and managers with the right tools to maintain productivity without being bogged down in day-to-day task delegation.
